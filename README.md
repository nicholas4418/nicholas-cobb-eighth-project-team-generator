# Eighth Project: Object Oriented Programming - Team Profile Generator

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to create a Team Profile Generator using Object Oriented Programming.
- I worked on this project to better understand the concepts of OOP and its use in web development.
- The problem this project solves is that it allows me to understand how OOP is an effective and efficient means of coding and how it can be useful in web development.
- I have learned that Object Oriented Programming can allow one's code to be more flexible and, in some cases, more versatile.
- The project itself is Team Profile Generator that allows a user to quickly create a brief team profile using the command-line prompts.
